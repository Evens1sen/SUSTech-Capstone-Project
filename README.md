# An Anomaly Detection Platform for Urban Traffic Streaming

With the rapid development and popularization of Internet
of Things (IoT) technology, the way we interact with urban environments has
been completely changed. For building a smart city, predicting and detecting
anomalies in urban traffic flow is a crucial area in intelligent transportation
systems. However, the strong real-time nature of traffic data and complexity of
spatiotemporal big data make it an extremely challenging task. Our project aims
to develop a platform for analyzing and detecting anomalies in urban traffic flow
data. Unlike previous solutions, we will use Apache-Flink stream computing
framework to process and analyze real-time data to monitor inflow/outflow in-
dicators for taxis and shared bicycles. We will also integrate deep learning-
based spatiotemporal traffic flow prediction algorithms for anomaly detection.
